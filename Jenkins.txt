Jenkins
---------------
GitHub --> Source code Manager
Maven --> build tool
Tomcat --> Application server 
SonarQube --> Source code quality management tool 
Nexus --> Artifactory repository 
Jenkins --> CI/CD tool 

Jenkins is a open source, Java based Continuous Integartion tool 
It is also called as HudSon
In 2011 a community was formed called Jenkins community and they built a tool called Jenkins 

It is built on Java but it supports many other languages 

CI --> Process of automating the build and run the unit test cases as soon as DEV push the code to source code management.
In CI there is no Deployment Process

CI benefits 
--------------------
Immediate Bug detection 
No Integration step in SDLC 
Deployable package at any point
We can record the evolution of the project

Continuous Delivery
---------------------
Here we need to manually trigger the deployment 
We are using this for External applications

Continuous Deployment
----------------------
All the environments are automated 
We are using this for Internal Applications

Using Jenkins we can Integrate version control system (GitHub, GitLab,BitBucket)
Can generate the test reports 
JaCoCo --> Java Code Coverage is a plugin used by Jenkins to do JUnit test cases 
This plugin can also stop the deployment 
If the Code coverage is <80% then Jenkins can stop deployment 
Push the builds to Artifactory repository 
can deploy directly to Prod or test 
Can notify to stake holders regarding success/failure of build 

Benefits of Jekins 
-----------------------
It is Open source 
Easy to install and minimal configurations 
Has over 1800+ plugins 
Built using so works on all major systems 
Good Documentation and easy for beginners 

jenkins is Community Edition 
CloudbeesJenkins is enterprise edition

Jenkins Installation
---------------------------
Java 11 is Pre requisite 
Min 2GB RAM is needed just to install Jenkins but we need to integrate so we need atleast 4GB RAM 

Jenkins Installation
--------------------
yum install jenkins 
then we need to enable jenkins service 
					systemctl enable jenkins --> to enable jenkins 
					systemctl start jenkins --> to start Jenkins 

to access jenkins http://publicIP:8080
username: kedhar
password: Kedhar@5

Since we have enabled Jenkins as a service even if we donot use the start command in root server just by starting the server we can access it 

How to can create a Job in Jenkins
-----------------------------------
To start the integration all the application servers need to be up and running 
jenkins SonarQube Tomcat Nexus need to be up 

We need to get the repo link from the dev and paste it in jenkins 
Then add the Build steps

When we configure maven with Jenkins and run the build and still it is failed 
Because Maven is not installed in Jenkins server it is able to fetch the details from github but not able do do the build 
Installation: Dashboard --> manage jenkins --> add maven tab this has to be done on web we need to install git in Linux server 
This is a single time setup
After this go back to the job and configure 
In build steps add maven version and save and build 
after this the build is successful we can check the status in console output 
package built is stored here 
Building war: /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/flipkart-dev/target/maven-web-application.war
/var/lib/jenkins --> jenkins home directory 

if we give sonar:sonar gole the report will be generated 
But we need to configure SonarQube details in pom.xml file we can modify the credentials in GitHub 

Jenkins Integration to GitHub, maven , sonarQube ,nexus , Tomcat
------------------------------------------------------------------
With GitHub install git in Linux server
Sudo yum install git 
* credentials are not mandatory for public repositories 
* After getting code from GitHub we need to build package 
Maven 
------
go to Job --> configure --> Invoke maven targets --> then we give the goals 
Since maven is not installed in Jenkins server build wont be successful 
maven installation:-- dashboard --> tools --> maven installation tab --> version 
go to our job --> select the maven version --> Build now --> package will be created 

SonarQube 
---------------
To build the sonar report we need to use sonar:sonar goal 
We need to update the sonar creds in pom.xml in sonar.host.url mention the url and in sonar.login mention the key 
Go to the job --> build now --> package will b ecreated successfully 

nexus 
----------
After the report creation we need to upload the war file to Artifactory repository 
to do this we se the deploy goal 
nexus installation:-- take the release and SNAPSHOT link from nexus repo and in pom.xml file in the distribution management tag attach them both 
then we need to configure nexus credentials in settings.xml file 
the following tag needs to be included in the settings.xml file 
<server>
      <id>nexus</id>
      <username>admin</username>
      <password>Kedhar@5</password>
    </server>

to find the settings.xml file we need to use the find command in jenkins server 
find / -name settings.xml 

In the servers tag upload the above tag and build now the artifact is successfully uploaded now 

Tomcat
------------------
After theat we need to deploy the application to Tomcat server
We need to use deploy to container plugin to do this
Installation:-- Dashboard --> manage jenkins --> plugins --> available plugins (deploy to container) --> install
Then we go to job and in configure --> Post build action tab --> deploy war/ear to container --> add tomcat URL username / pwd here and build now 
Even then it wont be succesful becuase fro kedhar user we have given admin-gui manager-gui roles
to deploy the application to tomcat server we need to give manager-script role also in the tomcat-users.xml file 
Now build now and the application is deployed successfully
