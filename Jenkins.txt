Jenkins
---------------
GitHub --> Source code Manager
Maven --> build tool
Tomcat --> Application server 
SonarQube --> Source code quality management tool 
Nexus --> Artifactory repository 
Jenkins --> CI/CD tool 

Jenkins is a open source, Java based Continuous Integartion tool 
It is also called as HudSon
In 2011 a community was formed called Jenkins community and they built a tool called Jenkins 

It is built on Java but it supports many other languages 

CI --> Process of automating the build and run the unit test cases as soon as DEV push the code to source code management.
In CI there is no Deployment Process

CI benefits 
--------------------
Immediate Bug detection 
No Integration step in SDLC 
Deployable package at any point
We can record the evolution of the project

Continuous Delivery
---------------------
Here we need to manually trigger the deployment 
We are using this for External applications

Continuous Deployment
----------------------
All the environments are automated 
We are using this for Internal Applications

Using Jenkins we can Integrate version control system (GitHub, GitLab,BitBucket)
Can generate the test reports 
JaCoCo --> Java Code Coverage is a plugin used by Jenkins to do JUnit test cases 
This plugin can also stop the deployment 
If the Code coverage is <80% then Jenkins can stop deployment 
Push the builds to Artifactory repository 
can deploy directly to Prod or test 
Can notify to stake holders regarding success/failure of build 

Benefits of Jekins 
-----------------------
It is Open source 
Easy to install and minimal configurations 
Has over 1800+ plugins 
Built using so works on all major systems 
Good Documentation and easy for beginners 

jenkins is Community Edition 
CloudbeesJenkins  is enterprise edition

Jenkins Installation
---------------------------
Java 11 is Pre requisite 
Min 2GB RAM is needed just to install Jenkins but we need to integrate so we need atleast 4GB RAM 

yum install jenkins 
then we need to enable jenkins service 
systemctl enable jenkins --> to enable jenkins 
systemctl start jenkins --> to start Jenkins
