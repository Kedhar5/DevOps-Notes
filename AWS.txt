AWS
--------
DevOps is a methodology which is followed by dev team to deliver an application software 
Application is a program which is developed to perform certain business problems 

Stand Alone Application --> Any application which is developed to solve a problem and installed locally is called Stand Alone Application 

Web Application --> App which can run somewhere and we can access it from the browser using Internet or Intranet
	Static Web Application --> Frontend/UI development 
	Dynamic Web Application --> data processing application/ 3 tier application
			presentation tier (UI/GUI)
			Application tier (API)
			Data tier (Databases)
					-->SQL (MySQL, IBM DB2)
					-->NoSQL (MongoDB) here data will be stored as json document

Mobile Applications --> applications which can be accessed and can be run on mobiles 

App --> DB --> OS --> HardWare --> On premise Data Center 
the data center will be managed by the company itself inside their premises 

Business req: High availability, fault tolerent, Scalable, elasticity

Cloud service 
---------------------------
service provided to the user via internet from a Cloud computing providers 

Cloud Computing
---------------------------
on-demand delivery of Infrastructure resources over Internet.
Instead of having physical data centers we can have them as services from Cloud service providers such as AWS 
we can have services such as Servers Storage databases Software Analytics etc

Physical deployment
--------------------
Physical Server --> OS --> Software + Configuration + Environment --> Application 

Virtualization
--------------
Physical server --> Hypervisors --> Software + Configuration + Environment --> Application 
Hypervisors (which performs the virtualization or creates the virtual machines on top of physical server)
OS is not needed for type 1 Hypervisors
type 2 Hypervisor is software based 

AWS SERVICES 
----------------

1)EC2 - Elastic Cloud Computing
---------------------------------
EC2 provides on demand scalable computing capacity for servers 
EC2 is your computer in cloud server 
EC2 provide scalable compute capavity in AWS cloud 
Enables u to scale up or down to handle changes in requirement 
EC2 is used to launch as many or as less virtual servers 
Using Ec2 we can as many or as less servers as we needed
we can manage the security storage etc 
AWS has a clear documentation for all the services 

EC2 internally uses EBS VPC and other services for storage and security purposes 

Basic computer                   EC2
----------------------           ----------------------
OS 								 AMI's
CPU 							 Instance type 
ROM & RAM 						 RAM & EBS
Network Card					 IP addressing 
Firewall						 Security groups

AMI -- Here OS will be pre installed or else here the OS will be pre configured 
Instance type -- for General purpose and storage capacity 
	Capacity of Ec2 instance depands on instance type we select 

EC2 purchasing options
-------------------------
On-Demand
----------
Most expensive, Highly flexible, charged by hour, Terminate instnce anytime you want 

Reserved
----------
For a set of time period, Price discount, responsible for the entire price even if we terminate the instance 

Spot
-----
AWS sells unused instances for a low price for a short time 
Charged  by hour, price based on supply or demand in market 
we can vid on instance type and use if our price more than bid price 

Dedicated Host
---------------
Physical host is dedicated for single AWS customer 
Other AWS customers instance will not be created on the same physical Host 

How are we charged for using EC2
---------------------------------
1.Purchase option 
	On demand
	reserved 
	spot 
2.Instance family & type
	general purpose 
	compute optimized
	GPU optimized
	memory optimized
	storage optimized
3.EBS charges are additional 
4.AMI type
	Linux 
	Windows
5.Data Transfer
6.Region

Components of EC2
-------------------
Tags -- It is like labeling your things 
	these are used for identification and governance purpose 
	we can also use additional tags 
	
AMI -- Amazon Machine Image 
	Pre configured package which has OS and settings related to it
	Types
	------
	Community AMI 
		free to use and just has OS and general settings
	Marketplace AMI 
		OS+Additional licensed software
	MyAMI(Golden AMI)
		your own AMI with OS and Softwares
