GitHub
----------------------
Source code can not be shared via communicators such as Teams, Slack, Skype etc
We can use Source Code Management tools to send the code like GitHub GitLab BitBucket
Repository is a place where we can keep the source code

GitHub Enterprise is used in offices so that outers can not access the source code repositories

git@github.com:Kedhar-s-DevOps/flipkart.git --> SSH url

https://github.com/orgs/Kedhar-s-DevOps/teams/facebook-devteam
