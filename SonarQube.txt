SonarQube
--------------------
Open source, Java based code quality management tool 
Code Review: Going throufgh source code line by line 
To check whether devs followed standards or not 

Instead of going through line by line of a code manually SonarQube does it atomatically 
We can use this for other languages instead of Java also
