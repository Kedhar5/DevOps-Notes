SonarQube/ Sonar(earlier name)
---------------------------------
Open source, Java based code quality management tool 
Code Review: Going throufgh source code line by line 
To check whether devs followed standards or not 

Instead of going through line by line of a code manually SonarQube does it atomatically 
We can use this for other languages instead of Java also 
Vera code, HP fortyfy are similar tools 

SonarQube can be dwnlded as zip file then extrcated and used 

It will generate report in from of html/pdf
Supports multiple languages 
Cross-platform software 
Supports multiple databases (mySQL,postgreSQL etc..)

For languages like COBOL ABAP C C++ etc we need to have license and buy commercial version
FOr Java JS HTML JSP PHP Python etc license is not needed since they are open source 

SonarQube installation
-------------------------
Java --> Pre requisite
SonarQube inbuilt has a database called HQ database 

Architecture
------------------------------
SonarQube Scanner / SonarQube Server
Scanner scans the source code and generates teh report and gives it to server 
Scanner classifies the report to Bug Vulnerabilities Codesmells
After that report is stored in a database 

After installing sonarQube it will not run on root user 
we create a normal user and give the user root access and then switch the user 

in the Sonar user go to opt directoty and bin and you find a file sonar.sh
by running the script u can start the sonarQube 
In Linux if we run anything we will get a ProcessID
default port number is 9000
to access the SonarQube server http://PublicIP:9000
username: admin
Password: Kedhar@5

Initially when we access the Sonar server we will not be admitted
We need to enable the ports in security goups then access the server using above address
Default credentials are username:admin pswd:admin 


When we try to run sonar.sh file using bash sonar.sh start command it is not running 
Because we have tried from root user and we try to run the same from sonar user because temp directory is created and sonar user doesnt have access and normal user trying to create the same

Whenever you are not able to see the status of sonar as active you need to check because you might have tried to run sonar.sh from root user 
Since root user cant run sonar.sh sonar cant run and temp/ directory is created 
Since this sonar also tries to create temp directory you cant start the sonarQube
Delete the temp directory then run sonar.sh then it will execute 
temp directory willbe present in sonarqube directory and we donot have access to delete it
So we use "sudo rm -rf temp/"

										mvn clean sonar:sonar 
												  plugInname:Goalname 

the above command is used to generate the report for project
we need to run the code in Directory where pom.xml is present
Also we need to modify  <sonar.host.url>http://15.206.75.213:9000/</sonar.host.url> 
						<sonar.login>admin</sonar.login>
						<sonar.password>Kedhar@5</sonar.password>
These tags need to modified according to the server details

a single SonarQube server can be used for n number of projects

Configuring IP username and pwd in the pom.xml file is not a good practise 
To avoid this we can use Token 
Token Generation
--------------------
My account --> Security --> Generate token
squ_44400e8fc4b4c33b10e3170e5d37b5b8fce324cf

We can comment the password tag in pom.xml
<sonar.login> tag mention the token generated 
Save the token as it will be visible only once 

"npm run sonar" --> to execute nodeJS projects 
yum install nodejs -y 
nodejs is required torun this npm command 
for java project we configure in pom.xml file 
for JS sonar-project.js 
npm install --> to install all modules 

Thse particular need to be added in properties directory to get the report into a paricular sonarQube server 
<sonar.host.url>http://15.206.75.213:9000/</sonar.host.url>
                <sonar.login>squ_44400e8fc4b4c33b10e3170e5d37b5b8fce324cf</sonar.login>
                <!-- <sonar.password>Kedhar@5</sonar.password> -->
				
Quality Profiles
-------------------
Set of rules that need to be applied during an analysis 
Sonar way is the default quality profile name 

We can create our own QP to bypass the rules 

Quality Gate
----------------
Tab where we enter the conditions that need to be applied to that set of code 
both QP & QG are given to DEvOps team by developers 

SonarQube server integration with PostgreSQL will be on YT -mss channel
