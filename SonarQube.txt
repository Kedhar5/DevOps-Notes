SonarQube/ Sonar(earlier name)
---------------------------------
Open source, Java based code quality management tool 
Code Review: Going throufgh source code line by line 
To check whether devs followed standards or not 

Instead of going through line by line of a code manually SonarQube does it atomatically 
We can use this for other languages instead of Java also 
Vera code, HP fortyfy are similar tools 

SonarQube can be dwnlded as zip file then extrcated and used 

It will generate report in from of html/pdf
Supports multiple languages 
Cross-platform software 
Supports multiple databases (mySQL,postgreSQL etc..)

For languages like COBOL ABAp C C++ etc we need to have license and buy commercial version
FOr Java JS HTML JSP PHP Python etc license is not needed since they are open source 

SonarQube installation
