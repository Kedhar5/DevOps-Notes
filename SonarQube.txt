SonarQube/ Sonar(earlier name)
---------------------------------
Open source, Java based code quality management tool 
Code Review: Going throufgh source code line by line 
To check whether devs followed standards or not 

Instead of going through line by line of a code manually SonarQube does it atomatically 
We can use this for other languages instead of Java also 
Vera code, HP fortyfy are similar tools 

SonarQube can be dwnlded as zip file then extrcated and used 

It will generate report in from of html/pdf
Supports multiple languages 
Cross-platform software 
Supports multiple databases (mySQL,postgreSQL etc..)

For languages like COBOL ABAP C C++ etc we need to have license and buy commercial version
FOr Java JS HTML JSP PHP Python etc license is not needed since they are open source 

SonarQube installation
-------------------------
Java --> Pre requisite
SonarQube inbuilt has a database called HQ database 

Architecture
------------------------------
SonarQube Scanner / SonarQube Server
Scanner scans the source code and generates teh report and gives it to server 
Scanner classifies the report to Bug Vulnerabilities Codesmells
After that report is stored in a database 

After installing sonarQube it will not run on root user 
we create a normal user and give the user root access and then switch the user 

in the Sonar user go to opt directoty and bin and you find a file sonar.sh
by running the script u can start the sonarQube 
In Linux if we run anything we will get a ProcessID
default port number is 9000
to access the SonarQube server http://PublicIP:9000

Initially when we access the Sonar server we will not be admitted
We need to enable the ports in security goups then access the server using above address
Default credentials are username:admin pswd:admin
