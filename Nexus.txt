Nexus
----------------------
Nexus is a Open souce Java based artifactory repo.. which can be used to store and retrieve the built artifacts(Packages- jar/war/ear) whenever required


Package
-----------
java - war/ear/jar
Docker - Docker images 


Artifactory Repository
-----------------------
When we create a package that need to be stored in a artifactory repository.
In future to use that package as a reference.

Nexus is also called "Sonartype Nexus"
Jfrog Artifactory is another similar tool 

Difference b/w Github and Nexus
-------------------------------
GitHub is for source code management. Used to manage the source code
Nexus is artifactory repository which can manage the built artifacts 

Java 11 ins not supported for Nexus we need to install Java 8
Apart from Maven we can use JDK/JRE for every tool 
For Maven we just use JDK 

Just like SonarQube minimum requirement is 4GB RAM 
Nexus & SonarQube cannot be run on the same server.. Because at a time both cant run since the requirement is more than 7GB for both 

Install java 8 sudo yum install java-1.8.0-amazon-corretto-devel 
install wget 
wget 

acess Nexus server using 8081 port number
http://PublicIp:8081 
For nexus server the default password is dynamic the password addreess will be given to u by the server 

Change port number for applications
-----------------------------------
Tomcat --> server.xml
SonarQube --> conf/sonar.properties
nexus --> nexus/default properties 

Change port number in /opt/nexus/etc/nexus-default.properties 
after changing the port number we need to restart the service  
sudo service nexus restart 

Even though nexus is running we need to run the below commands to start the nexus server 
[nexus@ip-172-31-38-240 bin]$ sudo systemctl start nexus
[nexus@ip-172-31-38-240 bin]$ sudo systemctl status nexus

settings --> create repo --> maven (hosted) --> repo name 
we chose maven2(hosted) type repo because we chose maven java project 
If it is a nodeJS project we use npm and etc..
Based on language of project we select the repository type 

To change any configs of repositories Settings --> 
under URL column repo URL will be present 
http://13.233.192.12:8081/repository/Flipkart-release/
http://13.233.192.12:8081/repository/Flipkart-snapshot/
Then we need to configure Java projects with the given URL's 

In a java project in pom.xml file we need to confugure the URL's 
Configurations are done under <ditributionManagement> tag
<ditributionManagement> </ditributionManagement>
after configuring we can build the maven java project mvn clean package 
but we are uploading so we use mvn clean deploy 
Be sure to change username, password ,nexus URL in server.xml file  
If we donot change we get error 401 status code unauthorized which means credentials issue 
in /opt/apache-maven/conf/servers.xml file add the below tag in <servers> tag  
id user name pwd should match with ur nexus server 

<server>
      <id>nexus</id>
      <username>admin</username>
      <password>Kedhar@5</password>
    </server>

We have uploaded both release and snapshot but only snapshot is working 
The version tag contains SNAPSHOT keyword
If we deploy again it is not going to upload because of error "Repository does not allow updating assets: Flipkart-release (400)"
It is because the version name is same so we need to update the package and override the existing one 
to update that Server administration --> hosted tab --> Deployment policy should be Allow redeploy 

If we redploy these tabs will be modified automatically under .war file 
Blob created	Thu Dec 14 2023 15:34:37 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)
Blob updated	Thu Dec 14 2023 15:41:10 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)

Instead of configuring this we can alternatively change the version name in pom.xml

So we can either change the version number in pom.xml or else we can change the configuration as Allow Redeploy directly in the nexus server 
If we allow redepoly existing build will be overridden so we change the version names so that we can keep the artifacts intact 

In the <version tab> if we just use n.n.n we upload to releases 
If we use n.n.n-SNAPSHOT in <version> tag we upload to releases 

Releases wont be deployed if the version name is same 
SNAPSHOTS can deployed using the same version name because it stored as Sn-1 sn-2 etc...

http://13.233.192.12:8081/repository/kedhar-remoterepo/
This repo is used to store jar war ear files we can use both SNAPSHOTS and releases

To use this jar file we upload the file into a remote repo and then take the dependency tag 
http://13.233.192.12:8081/repository/kedhar-remoterepo/
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.mt</groupId>
  <artifactId>mail</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
after uploading the dependency we need to configure the repository tag in pom.xml and mirror tag in conf/settings.xml as below 
Only if we configure these both we can be able to create te package using the dependencies in the remote repository 
pom.xml
---------------------
<repositories> 
	<repository>
		<id>nexus</id>
		<url>http://13.233.192.12:8081/repository/kedhar-remoterepo/</url>
	</repository>
</repositories> 

settings.xml
--------------------------------
<mirror>
      <id>nexus</id>
      <mirrorOf>external:http:*</mirrorOf>
      <url>http://13.233.192.12:8081/repository/kedhar-remoterepo/</url>
      <blocked>false</blocked>
    </mirror>

So we create the repositories and upload the dependency and when we build package again dependencies can be downloaded from central repositories 

Go to projects
modify pom.xml
then modify settings.xml 
Proxy
-------------------
Instead of getting dependencies from Centreal to local repo to avoid viruses we use proxy repo 
<url>http://13.200.237.226:8081/repository/kedhar-proxy/</url>
THis has to be configured in repositories tag
After this go to conf directory in OPT and then in settings.xml under mirror tag this url need to configured
then we create the package and the dependencies are downloaded to proxy repo 
Since we mave created the maven custom local repo everytghing will be stored there
if we delete any file and try to build package then we might face error as dependency is not available in proxy repo 
To avoid this situation we use group repository

Group Repo 
---------------------
Group of repos from where we can get the dependencies 
settings --> create repo --> maven2(group)
While creating group repo we need to add all the repos which are necessary for building that package then we need to configure same as proxy repo 
Since we have grouped all repos and then build the packages we will not get the error 
Even though dependencies are not there in proxy repo nexus will download dependencies from group repo 
So the package will be built successfully

the working is similar we need to configure the url in both pom.xml and settings.xml using the group link 

DevOps admin roles
---------------------
using repositories tab we can create repositories
While creating repos we create blob stores to write the content 
Whatever data we upload it will be stored in blob stories -- default is the default blob 
S3 --> simple storage service is a type of blob 
If we create a blobstore wile creating repos we need to select a specific blob store for creating every repo 

Cleanup policies can be used to clean up the repositories 
We can set particular setting like when the artifact can be cleaned up after being deployed 

Instead of creating users in each tool like sonarQube nexus Tomcat etc in real time we use LDAP
