Nexus
----------------------
Nexus is a Open souce Java based artifactory repo.. which can be used to store and retrieve the built artifacts(Packages- jar/war/ear) whenever required


Package
-----------
java - war/ear/jar
Docker - Docker images 


Artifactory Repository
-----------------------
When we create a package that need to be stored in a artifactory repository.
In future to use that package as a reference.

Nexus is also called "Sonartype Nexus"
Jfrog Artifactory is another similar tool 

Difference b/w Github and Nexus
-------------------------------
GitHub is for source code management. Used to manage the source code
Nexus is artifactory repository which can manage the built artifacts 

Java 11 ins not supported for Nexus we need to install Java 8
Apart from Maven we can we JDK/JRE for every tool 
For Maven we just use JDK 

Just like SonarQube minimum requirement is 4GB RAM 
Nexus & SonarQube cannot be run on the same server.. Because at a time both cant run since the requirement is more than 7GB for both 

Install java 8 sudo yum install java-1.8.0-amazon-corretto-devel 
install wget 
wget 

acess Nexus server using 8081 port number
http://PublicIp:8081 
For nexus serber the default password is dynamic the password addreess will be given to u by the server 

Change port number for applications
-----------------------------------
Tomcat --> server.xml
SonarQube --> conf/sonar.properties
nexus --> nexus/default properties 

Change port number in /opt/nexus/etc/nexus-default.properties 
after changing the port number we need to restart the service  
sudo service nexus restart
